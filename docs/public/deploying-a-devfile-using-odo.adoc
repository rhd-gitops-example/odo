== Introduction to devfile

What is a devfile?

A https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/[devfile] is a portable file that describes your development environment. It allows reproducing a _portable_ developmental environment without the need of reconfiguration.

With a devfile you can describe:

* Development components such as container definition for build and application runtimes
* A list of pre-defined commands that can be run
* Projects to initially clone

Odo takes this devfile and transforms it into a workspace of multiple containers running on OpenShift, Kubernetes or Docker.

Devfiles are YAML files with a defined https://devfile.github.io/devfile/_attachments/api-reference.html[schema].

== Odo and devfile

Odo can now create components from devfiles as recorded in registries. Odo automatically consults the https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry[default registry] but users can also add their own registries. Devfiles contribute new component types that users can pull to begin development immediately.

An example deployment scenario:

. `odo create` will consult the recorded devfile registries to offer the user a selection of available component types and pull down the associated `devfile.yaml` file
. `odo push` parses and then deploys the component in the following order:
 .. Parses and validates the YAML file
 .. Deploys the development environment to your OpenShift cluster
 .. Synchronizes your source code to the containers
 .. Executes any prerequisite commands

== Deploying your first devfile

[discrete]

==== Prerequisites for an OpenShift Cluster

* Enable experimental mode for odo. This can be done by: `odo preference set experimental true`

* Create a project to keep your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a separate single unit.

. Log in to an OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a project:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo project create myproject
   ✓  Project 'myproject' is ready for use
   ✓  New project created and now using project : myproject
----


==== Prerequisites for a Kubernetes Cluster

* Enable experimental mode for odo. This can be done by: `odo preference set experimental true`

* Before proceeding, you must know your ingress domain name or ingress IP to specify `--host` for `odo url create`.
+
Ingress IP is usually the external IP of ingress controller service, for Minikube or CRC clusters running in a virtual machine you can get it by
`minikube ip` or `crc ip`. Checkout this https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[document] to know more about ingress.


== Listing all available devfile components

* Before deploying your first component, have a look at what is available:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo catalog list components
