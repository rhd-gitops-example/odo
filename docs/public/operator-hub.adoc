== Introduction to Operators

What is an Operator?

An Operator is essentially a link:https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/operators[custom controller]. It is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes-native application.

With Operators, odo allows you to create a service as defined by a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

Odo utilizes Operators and link:https://operatorhub.io/[Operator Hub] in order to provide a seamless method for custom controller service installation.

== Deploying your first Operator

==== Prerequisites

* You must have cluster permissions to install an Operator on either link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[OpenShift] or link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/install/install.md[Kubernetes].
* Enable experimental mode for odo. This can be done by: `odo preference set experimental true`

== Creating a project

Create a project to keep your source code, tests, and libraries
organized in a separate single unit.

. Log in to your cluster:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a project:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo project create myproject
   ✓  Project 'myproject' is ready for use
   ✓  New project created and now using project : myproject
----

== Installing an Operator

In our examples, we install link:https://etcd.io/[etcd], a distributed key-value store from link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/etcd[Operator Hub].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each Operator we install refers to the built-in `metadata.annotations.alm-examples` annotation in order to correctly deploy. If the Operator does not contain the correct metadata, you will not be able to correctly deploy. For more information, see the the link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/building-your-csv.md#crd-templates[upstream CRD documentation].

=== Kubernetes installation

For Kubernetes installation, you must install the Operator Lifecycle Manager and etcd from the link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/etcd[etcd installation guide on Operator Hub].

=== OpenShift installation

For OpenShift installation, the etcd Operator can be installed through the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[administrative console].

=== Listing all available Operators

Before deploying your first Operator, have a look at what is available:
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo catalog list services
  Operators available in the cluster
  NAME                          CRDs
  etcdoperator.v0.9.4           EtcdCluster, EtcdBackup, EtcdRestore
----

In above output, `etcdoperator.v0.9.4` is the Operator while `EtcdCluster`,
`EtcdBackup` and `EtcdRestore` are the CRDs provided by this Operator.


=== Deploying etcd to a cluster

In this example, we will be deploying our link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/etcd[installed etcd Operator] to an OpenShift / Kubernetes cluster.

. Create a etcd service from the `etcdoperator.v0.9.4` Operator:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo service create etcdoperator.v0.9.4/EtcdCluster
----

. Confirm the Operator backed service was deployed:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo service list
----

It is important to note that `EtcdBackup` and `EtcdRestore` are **not** available for deployment as they require interactive parameters.

=== Deploying etcd to a cluster via YAML


In this example, we will be deploying our link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/etcd[installed etcd Operator] to an OpenShift / Kubernetes cluster.

However, we will be using the YAML definition where we modify the `metadata.name` and `spec.size`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deploying via YAML is a **temporary** feature as we add support for link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/issues/2785[passing parameters on the command line] and link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/issues/2799[interactive mode].
====

. Retrieve the YAML output of the operator:
+
[source,shell]
----
  $ odo service create etcdoperator.v0.9.4/EtcdCluster --dry-run > etcd.yaml
----

. Modify the YAML file by redefining the name and size:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: etcd.database.coreos.com/v1beta2
kind: EtcdCluster
metadata:
  name: my-etcd-cluster // Change the name
spec: 
  size: 1 // Reduce the size from 3 to 1
  version: 3.2.13
----

. Create the service from the YAML file:
+
[source,shell]
----
  $ odo service create --from-file etcd.yaml
----

. Confirm that the service has been created:
+
[source,shell]
----
  $ odo service list
----
